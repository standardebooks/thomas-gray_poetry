				<span>Ye distant spires, ye antique towers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That crown the wat’ry glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where grateful Science still adores</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her Henry’s holy Shade;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ye, that from the stately brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Windsor’s heights the expanse below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of grove, of lawn, of mead survey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose turf, whose shade, whose flowers among</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders the hoary Thames along</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His silver-winding way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah happy hills, ah pleasing shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah fields beloved in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where once my careless childhood strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stranger yet to pain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel the gales, that from ye blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A momentary bliss bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As waving fresh their gladsome wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My weary soul they seem to soothe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, redolent of joy and youth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To breathe a second spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full many a sprightly race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disporting on thy margent green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paths of pleasure trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who foremost now delight to cleave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pliant arm thy glassy wave?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The captive linnet which enthrall?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What idle progeny succeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chase the rolling circle’s speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or urge the flying ball?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While some on earnest business bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their murmuring labours ply</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Gainst graver hours, that bring constraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sweeten liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some bold adventurers disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The limits of their little reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And unknown regions dare descry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still as they run they look behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hear a voice in every wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And snatch a fearful joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gay hope is theirs by fancy fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less pleasing when possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tear forgot as soon as shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sunshine of the breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Theirs buxom health of rosy hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild wit, invention ever-new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lively cheer of vigour born;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thoughtless day, the easy night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spirits pure, the slumbers light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fly th’ approach of morn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas, regardless of their doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The little victims play!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sense have they of ills to come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor care beyond to-day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet see how all around ’em wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Ministers of human fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And black Misfortune’s baleful train!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, show them where in ambush stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seize their prey, the murtherous band!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah, tell them, they are men!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These shall the fury Passions tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vultures of the mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disdainful Anger, pallid Fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Shame that skulks behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pining Love shall waste their youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Jealousy with rankling tooth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That inly gnaws the secret heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Envy wan, and faded Care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grim-visaged comfortless Despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Sorrow’s piercing dart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ambition this shall tempt to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then whirl the wretch from high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bitter Scorn a sacrifice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grinning Infamy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stings of Falsehood those shall try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hard Unkindness’ altered eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That mocks the tear it forced to flow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keen Remorse with blood defiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moody Madness laughing wild<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid severest woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! in the vale of years beneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A grisly troop are seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The painful family of Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More hideous than their queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This racks the joints, this fires the veins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That every labouring sinew strains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those in the deeper vitals rage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, Poverty, to fill the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That numbs the soul with icy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And slow-consuming Age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To each his sufferings; all are men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned alike to groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tender for another’s pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unfeeling for his own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet ah! why should they know their fate?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since sorrow never comes too late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And happiness too swiftly flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought would destroy their paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more; where ignorance is bliss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis folly to be wise.</span>

				<span>’Twas on a lofty vase’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where China’s gayest art had dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The azure flowers, that blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demurest of the tabby kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pensive Selima, reclined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gazed on the lake below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her conscious tail her joy declared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair round face, the snowy beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The velvet of her paws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her coat, that with the tortoise vies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her ears of jet, and emerald eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw; and purred applause.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still had she gazed; but ’midst the tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two angel forms were seen to glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Genii of the stream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their scaly armour’s Tyrian hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through richest purple to the view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Betrayed a golden gleam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hapless nymph with wonder saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A whisker first and then a claw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many an ardent wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She stretched in vain to reach the prize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What female heart can gold despise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What Cat’s averse to fish?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Presumptuous maid! with looks intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again she stretched, again she bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knew the gulf between.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Malignant Fate sat by, and smiled)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slippery verge her feet beguiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She tumbled headlong in.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eight times emerging from the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She mewed to every wat’ry god,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some speedy aid to send.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Dolphin came, no Nereid stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor cruel Tom, nor Susan heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fav’rite has no friend!</span>

			<p>
				<span>From hence, ye Beauties, undeceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know, one false step is ne’er retrieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be with caution bold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all that tempts your wand’ring eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heedless hearts is lawful prize;</span>

				<span>Disclose the long-expecting flowers,</span>

				<span>Cool Zephyrs thro’ the clear blue sky</span>

			<p>

				<span class="i1">The panting herds repose;</span>

				<span class="i1">The busy murmur glows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The insect youth are on the wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eager to taste the honied spring,</span>

				<span>The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lowing herd wind slowly o’er the lea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves the world to darkness and to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the air a solemn stillness holds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower</span>

				<span>Of such as, wand’ring near her secret bower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Molest her ancient solitary reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree’s shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where heaves the turf in many a mould’ring heap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rude Forefathers of the hamlet sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The swallow twitt’ring from the straw-built shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cock’s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or busy housewife ply her evening care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No children run to lisp their sire’s return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How jocund did they drive their team afield!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!</span>

			<p>
				<span>Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,</span>

				<span class="i1">Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The short and simple annals of the poor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awaits alike th’ inevitable hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor you, ye Proud, impute to these the fault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Mem’ry o’er their tomb no trophies raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thro’ the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Can storied urn or animated bust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can Honour’s voice provoke the silent dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Flatt’ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich with the spoils of time did ne’er unroll;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chill Penury repressed their noble rage,</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full many a gem, of purest ray serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear;</span>

				<span>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And waste its sweetness on the desert air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some village-Hampden, that with dauntless breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The little tyrant of his fields withstood;</span>

				<span>Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,</span>

				<span class="i1">Some Cromwell guiltless of his country’s blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Th’ applause of list’ning senates to command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The threats of pain and ruin to despise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To scatter plenty o’er a smiling land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And read their history in a nation’s eyes,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their lot forbad; nor circumscribed alone</span>

				<span class="i1">Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With incense kindled at the Muse’s flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their sober wishes never learned to stray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the cool sequestered vale of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet ev’n these bones from insult to protect</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some frail memorial still erected nigh,</span>

				<span>With uncouth rhimes and shapeless sculpture decked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their name, their years, spelt by th’ unlettered Muse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place of fame and elegy supply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a holy text around she strews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That teach the rustic moralist to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This pleasing anxious being e’er resigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor cast one longing ling’ring look behind?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On some fond breast the parting soul relies,</span>

				<span class="i1">Some pious drops the closing eye requires;</span>

				<span>Ev’n from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There at the foot of yonder nodding beech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wreathes its old fantastic roots so high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His listless length at noontide would he stretch,</span>

				<span>Now drooping, woeful wan, like one forlorn,</span>

				<span class="i1">Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One morn I missed him on the customed hill,</span>

				<span>The next with dirges due in sad array</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Long Story</h2>
			<p>
				<span>In Britain’s Isle, no matter where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An ancient pile of building stands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Huntingdons and Hattons there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Employed the power of Fairy hands</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To raise the ceiling’s fretted height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each panel in achievements clothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich windows that exclude the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And passages, that lead to nothing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Full oft within the spacious walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he had fifty winters o’er him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My grave Lord-keeper led the brawls;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The seal, and maces, danced before him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His bushy beard, and shoe-strings green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His high-crowned hat, and satin-doublet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved the stout heart of England’s Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tho’ Pope and Spaniard could not trouble it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What, in the very first beginning!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shame of the versifying tribe!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your Hist’ry whither are you spinning?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can you do nothing but describe?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A house there is, (and that’s enough)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence one fatal morning issues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A brace of warriors, not in buff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But rustling in their silks and tissues.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The first came cap-a-pie from France,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her conqu’ring destiny fulfilling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom meaner beauties eye askance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly ape her art of killing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other Amazon kind Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had armed with spirit, wit, and satire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But <b>Cobham</b> had the polish given</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tipped her arrows with good-nature.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To celebrate her eyes, her air⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Coarse panegyrics would but tease her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Melissa is her nom de guerre.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas, who would not wish to please her!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With bonnet blue and capucine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aprons long they hid their armour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And veiled their weapons bright and keen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pity to the country farmer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fame, in the shape of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Purt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(By this time all the parish know it)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had told that thereabouts there lurked</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wicked imp they call a Poet,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who prowled the country far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bewitched the children of the peasants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dried up the cows, and lamed the deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sucked the eggs, and killed the pheasants.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My Lady heard their joint petition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swore by her coronet and ermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She’d issue out her high commission</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rid the manor of such vermin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Heroines undertook the task,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thro’ lanes unknown, o’er stiles they ventured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapped at the door, nor stayed to ask,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bounce into the parlour entered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The trembling family they daunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They flirt, they sing, they laugh, they tattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rummage his Mother, pinch his Aunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And up stairs in a whirlwind rattle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each hole and cupboard they explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each creek and cranny of his chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Run hurry-skurry round the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And o’er the bed and tester clamber;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into the drawers and china pry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Papers and books, a huge imbroglio!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under a tea-cup he might lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or creased, like dogs-ears, in a folio.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the first marching of the troops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Muses, hopeless of his pardon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conveyed him underneath their hoops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a small closet in the garden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Rumor says. (Who will, believe.)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that they left the door a-jar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, safe and laughing in his sleeve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He heard the distant din of war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Short was his joy. He little knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The power of Magic was no fable;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the window, whisk, they flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But left a spell upon the table.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The words too eager to unriddle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Poet felt a strange disorder;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transparent birdlime formed the middle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chains invisible the border.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So cunning was the apparatus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The powerful pot-hooks did so move him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, will he, nill he, to the great-house</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He went, as if the Devil drove him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet on his way (no sign of grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For folks in fear are apt to pray)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Phoebus he preferred his case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And begged his aid that dreadful day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The godhead would have backed his quarrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, with a blush on recollection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Owned that his quiver and his laurel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Gainst four such eyes were no protection.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Court was sate, the Culprit there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth from their gloomy mansions creeping</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lady <em>Janes</em> and <em>Joans</em> repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the gallery stand peeping.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such as in silence of the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come (sweep) along some winding entry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(<em>Styack</em> has often seen the sight)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or at the chapel-door stand sentry;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In peaked hoods and mantles tarnished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sour visages, enough to scare ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High Dames of honour once, that garnished</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The drawing-room of fierce Queen Mary!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Peeress comes. The audience stare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And doff their hats with due submission;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She curtsies, as she takes her chair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To all the people of condition.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Bard, with many an artful fib,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had in imagination fenced him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disproved the arguments of <em>Squib</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all that <em>Groom</em> could urge against him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But soon his rhetoric forsook him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the solemn hall had seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden fit of ague shook him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stood as mute as poor <em>Macleane</em>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet something he was heard to mutter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How in the park beneath an old tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Without design to hurt the butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or any malice to the poultry,)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He once or twice had penned a sonnet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet hoped, that he might save his bacon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Numbers would give their oaths upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ne’er was for a conjuror taken.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ghostly Prudes with hagged face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already had condemned the sinner.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My Lady rose, and with a grace⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She smiled, and bid him come to dinner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Jesu-Maria! Madame Bridget,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why, what can the Viscountess mean?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Cried the square hoods in woful fidget)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The times are altered quite and clean!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Decorum’s turned to mere civility;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her air and all her manners show it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commend me to her affability!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speak to a Commoner and Poet!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>[Here 500 Stanzas are lost.]</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so God save our noble King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And guard us from long-winded lubbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to eternity would sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keep my Lady from her rubbers.</span>

				<span>Uprose the King of Men with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saddled strait his coal-black steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the yawning steep he rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That leads to Hela’s drear abode.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him the Dog of Darkness spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His shaggy throat he opened wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While from his jaws, with carnage filled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foam and human gore distilled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hoarse he bays with hideous din,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes that glow, and fangs that grin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long pursues, with fruitless yell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father of the powerful spell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Onward still his way he takes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The groaning earth beneath him shakes,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till full before his fearless eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The portals nine of hell arise.</span>

			<p>
				<span class="i1">Right against the eastern gate,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Facing to the northern clime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice he traced the runic rhyme;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice pronounced, in accents dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thrilling verse that wakes the dead;</span>

				<span>The winter’s snow, the summer’s heat,</span>

					<h2 epub:type="title">The Fatal Sisters</h2>
					<h3 epub:type="title">An Ode from the Norse Tongue</h3>
					<h4>In the Orcades of Thormodus Torfseus; Hafniae, 1697, folio; and also in Bartholinus</h4>
				</hgroup>
				<h4 epub:type="preface">Advertisement</h4>
				<p>The Author once had thoughts (in concert with a Friend) of giving the History of English Poetry. In the Introduction to it he meant to have produced some specimens of the Style that reigned in ancient times among the neighbouring nations, or those who had subdued the greater part of this Island, and were our Progenitors; the following three Imitations made a part of them. He has long since dropped his design, especially after he heard, that it was already in the hands of a Person well qualified to do it justice, both by his taste, and his researches into antiquity.⁠—Gray, 1768.</p>
				<h4 epub:type="preface">Preface</h4>
				<p>In the Eleventh Century, Sigurd, Earl of the Orkney-Islands, went with a fleet of ships and a considerable body of troops into Ireland, to the assistance of Sictryg with the silken beard, who was then making war on his father-in-law Brian, king of Dublin; the Earl and all his forces were cut to pieces, and Sictryg was in danger of a total defeat; but the enemy had a greater loss by the death of Brian their king, who fell in the action. On Christmas Day (the day of the battle), a Native of Caithness in Scotland saw at a distance a number of persons on horseback riding full speed towards a hill, and seeming to enter into it. Curiosity led him to follow them, till looking through an opening in the rocks, he saw twelve gigantic figures resembling women; they were all employed about a loom; and as they wove, they sung the following dreadful Song; which, when they had finished, they tore the web into twelve pieces, and (each taking her portion) galloped six to the North and as many to the South.⁠—Gray, 1768.</p>

				<span>Rapt in celestial transport they,</span>

				<span>Yet hither oft a glance from high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They send of tender sympathy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bless the place, where on their opening soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First the genuine ardor stole.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas Milton struck the deep-toned shell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as the choral warblings round him swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meek Newton’s self bends from his state sublime,</span>

				<span>Where willowy Camus lingers with delight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft at the blush of dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I trod your level lawn,</span>

				<span>High potentates, and dames of royal birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mitred fathers in long order go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Edward, with the lilies on his brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From haughty Gallia torn,</span>

				<span>And sad Chatillon, on her bridal morn</span>

				<span>All that on Granta’s fruitful plain</span>

				<span>Heavier toil, superior pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the bright reward we gain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grateful memory of the good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet is the breath of vernal shower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bee’s collected treasures sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet music’s melting fall, but sweeter yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The still small voice of gratitude.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Foremost and leaning from her golden cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The venerable Margaret see!</span>

				<span>To this, thy kindred train, and me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleased in thy lineaments we trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Tudor’s fire, a Beaufort’s grace.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>Air.</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thy liberal heart, thy judging eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flower unheeded shall descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid it round heaven’s altars shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fragrance of its blushing head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall raise from earth the latent gem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glitter on the diadem.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Lo! Granta waits to lead her blooming band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not obvious, not obtrusive, she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No vulgar praise, no venal incense flings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dares with courtly tongue refined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Profane thy inborn royalty of mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She reveres herself and thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With modest pride to grace thy youthful brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The laureate wreath, that Cecil wore, she brings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to thy just, thy gentle hand</span>

				<span>Dramatis Personae.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agrippina, the Empress-mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nero, the Emperor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poppaea, believed to be in love with Otho.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Otho, a young man of quality, in love with Poppaea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seneca, the Emperor’s Preceptor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anicetus, Captain of the Guards.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Demetrius, the Cynic, friend to Seneca.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aceronia, Confidant to Agrippina.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scene.⁠—The Emperor’s villa at Baiae.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Argument.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drama opens with the indignation of Agrippina at receiving her son’s orders from Anicetus to remove from Baiae, and to have her guard taken from her. At this time Otho having conveyed Poppaea from the house of her husband Rufus Crispinus, brings her to Baiae, where he means to conceal her among the crowd; or, if his fraud is discovered, to have recourse to the Emperor’s authority; but, knowing the lawless temper of Nero, he determines not to have recourse to that expedient but on the utmost necessity. In the meantime he commits her to the care of Anicetus, whom he takes to be his friend, and in whose age he thinks he may safely confide. Nero is not yet come to Baiae; but Seneca, whom he sends before him, informs Agrippina of the accusation concerning Rubellius Plancus, and desires her to clear herself, which she does briefly, but demands to see her son, who, on his arrival, acquits her of all suspicion, and restores her to her honours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mean while, Anicetus, to whose care Poppaea had been intrusted by Otho, contrives the following plot to ruin Agrippina; he betrays his trust to Otho, and brings Nero, as it were by chance, to the sight of the beautiful Poppaea. The Emperor is immediately struck with her charms, and she, by a feigned resistance, increases his passion; though, in reality, she is from the first dazzled with the prospect of empire, and forgets Otho. She therefore joins with Anicetus in his design of ruining Agrippina, soon perceiving that it will be for her interest. Otho hearing that the Emperor had seen Poppaea, is much enraged; but not knowing that this interview was obtained through the treachery of Anicetus, is readily persuaded by him to see Agrippina in secret, and acquaint her with his fears that her son Nero would marry Poppaea. Agrippina, to support her own power, and to wean the Emperor from the love of Poppaea, gives Otho encouragement, and promises to support him. Anicetus secretly introduces Nero to hear their discourse; who resolves immediately on his mother’s death, and, by Anicetus’s means, to destroy her by drowning. A solemn feast, in honour of their reconciliation, is to be made; after which she being to go by sea to Bauli, the ship is so contrived as to sink or crush her; she escapes by accident, and returns to Baiae.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this interval Otho has an interview with Poppaea; and being duped a second time by Anicetus and her, determines to fly with her into Greece, by means of a vessel which is to be furnished by Anicetus; but he, pretending to remove Poppaea on board in the night, conveys her to Nero’s apartment; she there encourages and determines Nero to banish Otho, and finish the horrid deed he had attempted on his mother. Anicetus undertakes to execute his resolves; and, under pretence of a plot upon the Emperor’s life, is sent with a guard to murder Agrippina, who is still at Baiae in imminent fear, and irresolute how to conduct herself. The account of her death, and the Emperor’s horror and fruitless remorse, finishes the drama.</span>

				<span>Agrippina. Aceronia.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agrip. ’Tis well, begone! your errand is performed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>[Speaks as to Anicetus entering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The message needs no comment. Tell your master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mother shall obey him. Say you saw her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yielding due reverence to his high command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone, unguarded and without a lictor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fits the daughter of Germanicus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say, she retired to Antium; there to tend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her household cares, a woman’s best employment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What if you add, how she turned pale and trembled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You think, you spied a tear stand in her eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would have dropped, but that her pride restrained it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Go! you can paint it well) ’twill profit you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And please the stripling. Yet ’twould dash his joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear the spirit of Britannicus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet walks on earth; at least there are who know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without a spell to raise, and bid it fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand haughty hearts, unused to shake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a boy frowns, nor to be lured with smiles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To taste of hollow kindness, or partake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hospitable board; they are aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the unpledged bowl, they love not aconite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Acer. He’s gone; and much I hope these walls alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mute air are privy to your passion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive your servant’s fears, who sees the danger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which fierce resentment cannot fail to raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In haughty youth, and irritated power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agrip. And dost thou talk to me, to me, of danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of haughty youth and irritated power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her that gave it being, her that armed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This painted Jove, and taught his novice hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To aim the forked bolt; while he stood trembling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scared at the sound, and dazzled with its brightness?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis like, thou hast forgot, when yet a stranger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To adoration, to the grateful steam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of flattery’s incense, and obsequious vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From voluntary realms, a puny boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decked with no other lustre, than the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Agrippina’s race, he lived unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fame, or fortune; haply eyed at distance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some edileship, ambitious of the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To judge of weights and measures; scarcely dared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Expectation’s strongest wing to soar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as the consulate, that empty shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of long-forgotten liberty; when I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oped his young eye to bear the blaze of greatness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showed him where empire towered, and bade him strike</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble quarry. Gods! then was the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shrink from danger; fear might then have worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mask of prudence; but a heart like mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A heart that glows with the pure Julian fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If bright Ambition from her craggy seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Display the radiant prize, will mount undaunted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gain the rough heights, and grasp the dangerous honour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Acer. Through various life I have pursued your steps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have seen your soul, and wondered at its daring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence rise my fears. Nor am I yet to learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How vast the debt of gratitude which Nero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To such a mother owes; the world, you gave him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffices not to pay the obligation.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well remember too (for I was present)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When in a secret and dead hour of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Due sacrifice performed with barb’rous rites</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of muttered charms, and solemn invocation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You bade the Magi call the dreadful powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That read futurity, to know the fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impending o’er your son; their answer was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the son reign, the mother perishes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perish (you cried) the mother! reign the son!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He reigns, the rest is heaven’s; who oft has bad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even when its will seemed wrote in lines of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th’ unthought event disclose a whiter meaning.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think too how oft in weak and sickly minds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sweets of kindness lavishly indulged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rankle to gall; and benefits too great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be repaid, sit heavy on the soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As unrequited wrongs. The willing homage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of prostrate Rome, the senate’s joint applause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The riches of the earth, the train of pleasures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wait on youth, and arbitrary sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These were your gift, and with them you bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The very power he has to be ungrateful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agrip. Thus ever grave and undisturbed reflection</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pours its cool dictates in the madding ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of rage, and thinks to quench the fire it feels not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say’st thou I must be cautious, must be silent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tremble at the phantom I have raised?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carry to him thy timid counsels. He</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance may heed ’em. Tell him, too, that one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had such liberal power to give, may still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With equal power resume that gift, and raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tempest that shall shake her own creation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To its original atoms⁠—tell me, say!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This mighty emperor, this dreaded hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has he beheld the glittering front of war?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knows his soft ear the trumpet’s thrilling voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And outcry of the battle? Have his limbs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweat under iron harness? Is he not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silken son of dalliance, nursed in ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pleasure’s flowery lap?⁠—Rubellius lives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Sylla has his friends, though schooled by fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bow the supple knee, and court the times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shows of fair obeisance; and a call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like mine, might serve belike to wake pretensions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drowsier than theirs, who boast the genuine blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our imperial house.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Acer. Did I not wish to check this dangerous passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might remind my mistress that her nod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can rouse eight hardy legions, wont to stem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With stubborn nerves the tide, and face the rigour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of bleak Germania’s snows. Four, not less brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in Armenia quell the Parthian force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the warlike Corbulo, by you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marked for their leader; these, by ties confirmed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of old respect and gratitude, are yours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely the Masians too, and those of Egypt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not forgot your sire; the eye of Rome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Praetorian camp have long revered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With customed awe, the daughter, sister, wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mother of their Caesars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Agrip. Ha! by Juno,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It bears a noble semblance. On this base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My great revenge shall rise; or say we sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trump of Liberty; there will not want,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in the servile senate, ears to own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her spirit-stirring voice; Soranus there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Cassius, Vetus too, and Thrasea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Minds of the antique cast, rough, stubborn souls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That struggle with the yoke. How shall the spark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unquenchable, that glows within their breasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blaze into freedom, when the idle herd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Slaves from the womb, created but to stare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bellow in the Circus) yet will start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shake ’em at the name of Liberty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stung by a senseless word, a vain tradition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As there were magic in it! Wrinkled beldams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teach it their grandchildren, as somewhat rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That anciently appeared, but when, extends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond their chronicle⁠—oh! ’tis a cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To arm the hand of childhood, and rebrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slackened sinews of time-wearied age.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yes, we may meet, ingrateful boy, we may!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again the buried Genius of old Rome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall from the dust uprear his reverend head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roused by the shout of millions; there before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His high tribunal thou and I appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let majesty sit on thy awful brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lighten from thy eye; around thee call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gilded swarm that wantons in the sunshine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy full favour; Seneca be there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In gorgeous phrase of laboured eloquence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dress thy plea, and Burrhus strengthen it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his plain soldier’s oath, and honest seeming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against thee, Liberty and Agrippina;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world, the prize; and fair befall the victors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But soft! why do I waste the fruitless hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In threats unexecuted? Haste thee, fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>69These hated walls that seem to mock my shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast me forth in duty to their lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My thought aches at him; not the basilisk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More deadly to the sight, than is to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cool injurious eye of frozen kindness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not meet its poison. Let him feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before he sees me. Yes, I will be gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not to Antium⁠—all shall be confessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whate’er the frivolous tongue of giddy fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has spread among the crowd; things, that but whispered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have arched the hearer’s brow, and riveted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes in fearful ecstasy; no matter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What; so’t be strange, and dreadful.⁠—Sorceries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assassinations, poisonings⁠—the deeper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My guilt, the blacker his ingratitude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you, ye manes of Ambition’s victims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enshrined Claudius, with the pitied ghosts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Syllani, doomed to early death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Ye unavailing horrors, fruitless crimes!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If from the realms of night my voice ye hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of penitence, and vain remorse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accept my vengeance. Though by me ye bled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was the cause. My love, my fears for him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dried the soft springs of pity in my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And froze them up with deadly cruelty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet if your injured shades demand my fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If murder cries for murder, blood for blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me not fall alone; but crush his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sink the traitor in his mother’s ruin.</span>

				<span>Otho. Thus far we’re safe. Thanks to the rosy queen</span>

				<span>Of amorous thefts; and had her wanton son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lent us his wings, we could not have beguiled</span>

				<br/>
				<span>With fond reluctance, yielding modesty,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Must sick’ning virtue fly the tainted ground?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unmanly thought! what seasons can control,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What fancied zone can circumscribe the Soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, conscious of the source from whence she springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Reason’s light, on Resolution’s wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spite of her frail companion, dauntless goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Libya’s deserts and through Zembla’s snows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bids each slumb’ring energy awake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another touch, another temper take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suspends th’ inferior laws that rule our clay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stubborn elements confess her sway,</span>

				<span>Their little wants, their low desires, refine,</span>

				<span>And raise the mortal to a height divine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not but the human fabric from the birth</span>

				<span>As various tracts enforce a various toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The manners speak the idiom of their soil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An iron-race the mountain-cliffs maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foes to the gentler genius of the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For where unwearied sinews must be found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With side-long plough to quell the flinty ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To turn the torrent’s swift-descending flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To brave the savage rushing from the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wonder, if to patient valour trained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They guard with spirit what by strength they gained?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while their rocky ramparts round they see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rough abode of want and liberty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As lawless force from confidence will grow)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Insult the plenty of the vales below?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wonder in the sultry climes, that spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Nile redundant o’er his summer-bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his broad bosom life and verdure flings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And broods o’er Egypt with his wat’ry wings,</span>

				<span>If with adventurous oar and ready sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dusky people drive before the gale;</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Now the golden Morn aloft</span>

				<span>Till April starts, and calls around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sleeping fragrance from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lightly o’er the living scene</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scatters his freshest, tenderest green.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>New-born flocks, in rustic dance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frisking ply their feeble feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of their wintry trance,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span>His trembling thrilling ecstasy</span>

				<span>Melts into air and liquid light.</span>

				<span>Rise, my soul! on wings of fire,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Hark! ’tis Nature strikes the lyre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leads the general song.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yesterday the sullen year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw the snowy whirlwind fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mute was the music of the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Herd stood drooping by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their raptures now that wildly flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No yesterday, nor morrow know;</span>

				<span>Behind the steps that Misery treads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approaching Comfort view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hues of Bliss more brightly glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chastised by sabler tints of woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blended form, with artful strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strength and harmony of Life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See the Wretch, that long has tost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the thorny bed of Pain,</span>

				<span>At length repair his vigour lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And breathe and walk again;</span>

				<span>The meanest flowret of the vale,</span>

				<span>Then his character, <em>Phyzzy</em>,⁠—his morals⁠—his life⁠—</span>

				<span>They say he’s no Christian, loves drinking and whoring,</span>

				<span>And all the town rings of his swearing and roaring!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And filching and lying, and Newgate-bird tricks;⁠—</span>

				<span>He drinks⁠—so did Noah;⁠—he swears⁠—so do I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reject him for such peccadillos, were odd;</span>

				<span>Old, and abandoned by each venal friend,</span>

				<span class="i1">Here Holland formed the pious resolution</span>

			<p>
				<span>On this congenial spot he fixed his choice;</span>

				<span>Here reign the blustering North and blighting East,</span>

				<span>Here mouldering fanes and battlements arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turrets and arches nodding to their fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unpeopled monast’ries delude our eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mimic desolation covers all.</span>

				<span>“Ah!” said the sighing peer, “had Bute been true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Mungo’s, Rigby’s, Bradshaw’s friendship vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far better scenes than these had blest our view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And realised the beauties which we feign;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Purged by the sword, and purified by fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then had we seen proud London’s hated walls;</span>

				<span>Owls would have hooted in <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s choir,</span>

				<span>Much have I borne from cankered critic’s spite,</span>

			<p>
				<span>’Tis true, our master’s temper natural</span>

				<span>If then he wreak on me his wicked will;</span>
